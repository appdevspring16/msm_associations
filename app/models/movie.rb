  # here is the short cut for calling data from another model... say model director... so when code calls :director it now knows it belongs to the table Director by the fk director_id  for example @movie.director.name normally would not work because director is not a field/method in the Movie model

  belongs_to(:director, :class_name => "Director", :foreign_key =>"director_id")

has_many :actors, :through => :characters

  # short cut2
  has_many(:characters, :class_name => "Character", :foreign_key =>"movie_id")

  # when do you use one over the other
